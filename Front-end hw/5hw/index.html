                    <p><img src="high-resolution-new-york-skyline-sunset-l.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">New York, often called New York City to distinguish it from New York State, or NYC for short, is the most populous city in the United States. 
                        With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the 
                        United States. Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area 
                        in the world by urban area. With over 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, 
                        it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly 
                        influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports, and is the most photographed city in 
                        the world. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy, and has sometimes been called 
                        the capital of the world. Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is coextensive 
                        with a respective county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn (Kings County), Queens (Queens County), Manhattan (New York County), the Bronx 
                        (Bronx County), and Staten Island (Richmond County)—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single municipal entity in 1898. The city 
                        and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making 
                        it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the largest 
                        foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan 
                        product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is 
                        home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.</p>

                    <h2>Manhattan</h2>
                </section>
                <section id="main-content">
                    <p><img src="1920px-Above_Gotham.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">Manhattan , known regionally as the City, is the most densely populated and geographically smallest of the five boroughs of New York 
                        City. It is the urban core of the New York metropolitan area, and coextensive with New York County, one of the original counties of the U.S. 
                        state of New York. Manhattan serves as the city's economic and administrative center, cultural identifier, and historical birthplace. The borough consists 
                        mostly of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East, and Harlem rivers; as well as several small adjacent islands. Manhattan additionally contains Marble 
                        Hill, a small neighborhood now on the U.S. mainland, separated from the rest of Manhattan by the Harlem Ship Canal and later connected using landfill to The 
                        Bronx. Manhattan Island is divided into three informally bounded components, each cutting across the borough's long axis: Lower, Midtown, and Upper Manhattan. 
                        Manhattan has been described as the cultural, financial, media, and entertainment capital of the world, and the borough hosts the United Nations Headquarters. 
                        Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading 
                        financial center of the world, and Manhattan is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization: the New York 
                        Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Many multinational media conglomerates are based in Manhattan, and the borough has been the setting for numerous books, 
                        films, and television shows. Manhattan real estate has since become among the most expensive in the world, with the value of Manhattan Island, including real 
                        estate, estimated to exceed US$3 trillion in 2013; median residential property sale prices in Manhattan approximated US$1,600 per square foot 
                        ($17,000/m2) as of 2018, with Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commanding the highest retail rents in the world, at US$3,000 per square foot ($32,000/m2) 
                        per year in 2017. Manhattan traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; 
                        the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The territory and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles 
                        II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York, based in present-day Manhattan, served as the capital of the United States 
                        from 1785 until 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to America by ship in the late 19th century and is a world 
                        symbol of the United States and its ideals of liberty and peace. Manhattan became a borough during the consolidation of New York City in 1898.</p>

                <section id="main-content">
                    <p><img src="Long_Island_City_New_York_May_2015_panorama_3.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">Queens is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Queens County, in the U.S. state of New York. It is the largest borough of New York City in area and is 
                        adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the western end of Long Island, with Nassau County to the east. Queens also shares water borders with the boroughs 
                        of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island (via the Rockaways).<br>Queens is the second-largest in population of the five New York City boroughs with a 
                        population of 2,405,464 as of the 2020 census. If each borough were ranked as a city, Queens would rank as the fourth-most-populous in the U.S., after Los 
                        Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Approximately 47 percent of the residents of Queens are foreign-born. Queens County also is the second-most-populous county in 
                        New York State, behind Kings County. Queens is the most linguistically diverse place on Earth and is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the United 
                        States.<br>Queens was established in 1683 as one of the original 12 counties of the Province of New York. The settlement was presumably named for the English 
                        Queen Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705). From 1683 to 1899, the County of Queens included what is now Nassau County. Queens became a borough during the 
                        consolidation of New York City in 1898, combining the separate towns of Long Island City, Newtown, Flushing, Jamaica, and western Hempstead. With the 
                        exception of Hempstead, all are today considered neighborhoods of Queens.<br>Queens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs of New York City. It 
                        is home to two of New York City's airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. Landmarks in Queens which support its economy 
                        include Flushing Meadows–Corona Park; Citi Field, home to the New York Mets baseball team; the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, site of the U.S. 
                        Open tennis tournament; Kaufman Astoria Studios; Silvercup Studios; and the Aqueduct Racetrack. Flushing is undergoing rapid gentrification with investment 
                        by Chinese transnational entities,[14] while Long Island City is undergoing gentrification secondary to its proximity across the East River from Manhattan.</p>
